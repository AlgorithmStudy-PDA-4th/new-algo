### 정답
```sql
SELECT CATEGORY, PRICE AS MAX_PRICE, PRODUCT_NAME
FROM FOOD_PRODUCT
WHERE PRICE IN (
    SELECT MAX(PRICE) 
    FROM FOOD_PRODUCT 
    GROUP BY CATEGORY)
    AND CATEGORY IN ('과자', '국', '김치', '식용유')
ORDER BY MAX_PRICE DESC
```

### 오답
```sql
SELECT CATEGORY, MAX(PRICE) AS MAX_PRICE, PRODUCT_NAME
FROM FOOD_PRODUCT
GROUP BY CATEGORY
HAVING CATEGORY IN ('과자', '국', '김치', '식용유')
ORDER BY MAX_PRICE DESC
```
위처럼 코드를 `MAX(PRICE)`로 짜면 가격만 max로 받아오고 그 행 데이터를 받아오지 못함
